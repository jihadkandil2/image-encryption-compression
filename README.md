# Image Encryption and Compression

### Problem Definition:-

Image Encryption:
The process of encoding an image in a manner that only authorized individuals can access it, typically through a password. Encryption ensures that the original image remains concealed unless decrypted with the correct key.

Image Compression:
Reducing the size of digital images to economize storage or transmission requirements. Compression methods aim to represent image data using fewer bits while preserving essential visual information.

### Some Usages:

1. Secured and fast image transmission.
2. Secured image storage.

### Project Requirements:

// will be writen later 

### Implementation requrired:
1-Image encryption and decryption using LFSR.
2-Image compression and decompression using Huffman Coding.
3-Save and load binary encoded and compressed files.

## Getting Started

// will be writen later ....

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio .
project is windows form application

```
Give examples
```

### Installing
...........write if something needed to be installed


## Running the tests



### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why Later ......

```
Give an example
