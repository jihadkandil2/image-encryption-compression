# Image Encryption and Compression

Problem Definition:
Image Encryption: The process of encoding an image in a manner that only authorized individuals can access it, typically through a password. Encryption ensures that the original image remains concealed unless decrypted with the correct key.
Image Compression: Reducing the size of digital images to economize storage or transmission requirements. Compression methods aim to represent image data using fewer bits while preserving essential visual information.

Some Usages:

1.Secured and fast image transmission.

2.Secured image storage .

Project Requirements:
// will be writen later 

Implementation requrired:
1-Image encryption and decryption using LFSR.
2-Image compression and decompression using Huffman Coding.
3-Save and load binary encoded and compressed files.
